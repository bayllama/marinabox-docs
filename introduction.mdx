# What is MarinaBox?

MarinaBox allows you to easily spin up isolated sandboxes on your local or cloud environment. Some use cases for this include:

1. **AI Agents Performing Tasks on a Computer**:
   AI agents often need access to a computer to perform tasks (e.g., Claude Computer Use). However, allowing them direct access to your computer can be risky since important files could be modified or sensitive data accessed. MarinaBox provides an isolated sandbox to perform these tasks securely.

2. **Web Navigation and Task Automation**:
   Allowing AI agents to navigate the web and automatically perform tasks is a popular use case. For example, booking an airline ticket. MarinaBox offers a sandboxed Chromium browser designed for such purposes.

3. **Enhanced User Experience for AI Tools**:
   Designing great AI-based tools and products increasingly relies on providing a great user experience. Human-in-the-loop components, where users take control at crucial moments, are essential. MarinaBox enables embedding a live session view of your sandbox, allowing users to take control of the application at any time.

4. **Browser Automation**:
   MarinaBox’s browser sandbox integrates directly with tools like Playwright and Selenium, making it an ideal choice for browser automation.

5. **Open-Source Alternative to Browserbase**:
   MarinaBox’s browser sandbox can also be thought of as an open-source alternative to Browserbase. It works seamlessly with Browserbase’s open-source web automation tool, StageHand.

MarinaBox is your go-to solution for creating secure, isolated environments for AI tasks, browser automation, and more.
