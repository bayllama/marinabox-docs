MarinaBox provides VNC-based live viewing capabilities for all sessions. You can view sessions directly in your browser.

## Getting Session VNC Port

First, list your active sessions to get the VNC port:

```bash
mb local list
```

You'll see output like this:

```json
{
  "session_id": "a963accd3608",
  "vnc_port": 5004,
  "status": "running",
  "resolution": "1200x800x24"
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Direct Browser Viewing

To view a session directly in your browser:

1. Note the `vnc_port` from the session details (e.g., `5004`)
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5004
```
