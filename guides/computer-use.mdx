MarinaBox integrates with Anthropic's Claude to provide natural language control over your sandboxed environments. This feature allows you to interact with your sandbox sessions using simple English commands.

## Setting Anthropic API Key

Before using the Computer Use feature, you need to set your Anthropic API key:

```bash
mb local set --anthropic-api-key "API_KEY"
```

This command securely stores your Anthropic API key for future Computer Use sessions.

## Computer Use CLI

The Computer Use feature allows you to control the sandboxed environment using natural language commands, similar to Claude's Computer Use capability. You can reference a session either by its ID or tag.

```bash
mb local computer-use "SESSION_ID_OR_TAG" --command "your natural language command"
```

### Examples

1. Control browser window:
```bash
mb local computer-use "TestSession" --command "maximize chromium window"
```

2. Navigate to a website:
```bash
mb local computer-use "abc123xyz" --command "navigate to github.com"
```

3. Perform complex tasks:
```bash
mb local computer-use "TestSession" --command "open a new tab, go to google.com, and search for 'MarinaBox documentation'"
```

All commands are executed within the isolated sandbox environment, ensuring that your main system remains secure and unaffected by any operations performed through Computer Use.
